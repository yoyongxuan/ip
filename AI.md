Used ChatGPT to generate in character lines to fit the tone of Horus from Warhammer 40K.
Added some of the best generated lines into the program.
ChatGPT came up with some surprisingly in-character and creative lines.

Used ChatGPT to generate JUnit tests for Tasks and its subclasses 
by inputting the contents of each file into ChatGPT. Although I was not satisfied with 
the accurry and implementation of the tests generated by ChatGPT, the generated code 
was still useful as a template to write my own tests and as a guide of what cases I should test.
While generating JUnit tests, ChatGPT also found a bug with my program, which I then fixed.
